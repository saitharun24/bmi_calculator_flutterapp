# bmi_calculator_flutterapp
This is a simple app designed using flutter to calculate the BMI of a person.


We have gone for a tile based approach here, where the components are divided into tiles, with each tile intended to collect a specific information from the user. This information would then be used to calculate the BMI which will then be displayed in the next page.

Below are the pictures of the application and the video of the app while it is working.
